Welcome To this memory game where you can test you memory and see how many attemps it takes for you to complete.

## Getting Started

Visit https://rgraingerdev.github.io/js/ on your preferred web browser to access the Memory game.

## User Storys
I have developed user stories to direct my design and development process; in order to make sure that the game satisfies the requirements of my users. Here are some usage examples for user stories:


* As a fan of memory games i want to be able to quickly and conveniently start a new game so that i can engage with the game without delays.
* As a player i want to be able to play on diferent devices such as moblie phones and tablets, so i can enjoy anywhere.
* As a player i want to have a way to an easy and intuitive navigation system.
* As a player i want to have a way to read the rules and mechanics of the game.
* i would like a scoreboard so i can see how i am doing against other players.
* i want the game to be simple so my children can play.


By developing user stories, I can make sure that the website satisfies user needs and offers a satisfying browsing experience. I regularly gather user feedback and apply it to the design and functionality of the website.

## UI/UX

* The aim is for a first-time user to be able to easily navigate.
* The colour scheme was chosen to be easy on the eye and not draw attention from the content with the intention of making it simple for a novice user to navigate. 
* This page was made so that adults and children have a quick and convinient way of playing.

### Future features
* Add a scoreboard to mesure your score against other players.
* A time to see how fast you can solve.
* Add a user input to dictate the size of the game.

### Font

* Quicksand was the font I chose. The typeface was picked because it is slick and simple for the end user to read, additionally it comes from Google Fonts.

## Technologies used
* HTML - Was used for the structure of the page.
* CSS - was used for the style of elements.
* Github - is the hosting site for storing the code and version control.
* Javascript - used for interactivity of the site.
* balsamiq - used for wireframes.
* google fonts - used for the Quicksand font.
* Devtools - used for debugging and testing to ensure responsiveness.
* Google chrome lighthouse - used for testing.
* W3C HTML Validator - used for validating HTML of the page.
* W3C CSS validator - used for validating CSS of the page.

## Testing
The Memory game has undergone comprehensive testing to guarantee that it operates properly and offers a satisfying user experience. The website has been tested on a variety of hardware, browsers, and operating systems, including:

Systems running Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Web browsers such as Safari, Edge, Firefox and Chrome that can run on mobile and desktop.
I carried out user testing to gather opinions from people. I used this feedback to improve the website's functionality and appearance.
